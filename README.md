# First-Order-Logic-Evaluator
- First Order Logic inference can be used to deduce newer facts from existing statements in many real-life applications
- The aim of this project is to develop a beta version of a system in a Pharma company using First-Order Logic resolution
- RipeApe pharmacy is a self-service automated system to alert customers about potential drug interactions for both prescription and over-the-counter drugs
- The patient history and drug compatibility data is encoded as first order logic clauses in the knowledge base
- The program takes a query of new drug list and provide a logical conclusion whether to issue a warning
- First-Order Logic Resolution algorithm is implemented to resolve a given query
- The result is a decision whether to issue a warning about a drug to a patient
- Refer to project_description.pdf for implementation details
